            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>This site is dedicated to designing and developing websites and apps committed to language learning, maintenance, and revitalization, serving communities whose languages are at risk of being lost.</p>
            
            <p>There are hundreds of apps and websites out there that aim to teach Indigenous languages. Most of them only focus on a few hundred vocabulary items and simple phrases using a simple read, listen, and repeat model for memorization. My goal is to try to develop apps that use diverse methods to present more comprehensive, effective, and well-rounded language lessons in a fun and approachable way in order to build better fluency.</p>
